# Centsible - Learning Guide

This is a simplified version of the Centsible expense tracking application, designed specifically for **project-based learning**. All complex functionality has been removed and replaced with static mock data, allowing you to focus on learning React concepts, TypeScript, and modern web development patterns without getting overwhelmed by business logic.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

This project is structured to help you learn:
- **React Fundamentals**: Components, props, state, hooks, and context
- **TypeScript**: Type safety, interfaces, and type definitions
- **Modern CSS**: Tailwind CSS utility classes and responsive design
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable UI components and design systems
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and graphs with Recharts
- **State Management**: React Context for global state
- **Routing**: Single-page application navigation

## üìö Technology Stack Deep Dive

### **React 18**
**What it is**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs). It lets you create reusable "components" that update automatically when data changes.

**Why we use it**: Makes building interactive web apps easier. Instead of manually updating HTML, React handles changes efficiently.

**Key concepts you'll learn**:
- **Components**: Like building blocks - small, focused pieces of UI
- **Props**: Data passed between components (like function parameters)
- **State**: Data that can change over time (useState hook)
- **Hooks**: Special functions for managing state and side effects
- **JSX**: HTML-like syntax in JavaScript

### **TypeScript**
**What it is**: A superset of JavaScript that adds "types" (like labels for data). It helps catch errors early and makes code more reliable.

**Why we use it**: Prevents bugs by ensuring variables and functions use the correct data types (e.g., a number can't be treated as a string).

**Key concepts you'll learn**:
- **Interfaces**: Blueprints for objects (like a Transaction interface)
- **Types**: Custom labels for data structures
- **Type checking**: Compiler catches errors before runtime
- **Generic types**: Reusable types with parameters

### **Tailwind CSS**
**What it is**: A utility-first CSS framework. Instead of writing custom styles, you use pre-built classes (e.g., `bg-blue-500` for a blue background).

**Why we use it**: Speeds up styling and ensures consistency. It's great for responsive designs (adapting to different screen sizes).

**Key concepts you'll learn**:
- **Utility classes**: `flex`, `p-4` (padding), `hover:bg-gray-200`
- **Responsive design**: `md:`, `lg:` prefixes for different screen sizes
- **Dark mode**: Automatic theme switching
- **Component styling**: Combining utilities for custom components

### **Vite**
**What it is**: A build tool that compiles and serves your app quickly during development.

**Why we use it**: Faster than older tools like Create React App. It handles hot reloading (instant updates when you save files).

### **Shadcn/UI**
**What it is**: A collection of pre-built, customizable UI components (like buttons, modals) built on top of Radix UI and styled with Tailwind.

**Why we use it**: Saves time by providing ready-made components. They're accessible (work well with screen readers) and look professional.

### **Recharts**
**What it is**: A React library for creating charts and graphs.

**Why we use it**: Makes data visualization easy. You pass data as props, and it renders interactive charts.

### **React Router**
**What it is**: A library for handling navigation between pages in a React app.

**Why we use it**: Allows "single-page app" behavior (switching views without reloading the page).

### **Framer Motion**
**What it is**: A library for adding animations to React components.

**Why we use it**: Makes UIs feel smooth and engaging with transitions and effects.

## üìÅ Project Structure & File Explanations

Here's a detailed breakdown of every file and folder. I've included what each file does, why it exists, and how it fits into the bigger picture.

### **Root-Level Files**
- **`package.json`**: Project configuration. Lists all dependencies (React, Tailwind, etc.) and scripts (`npm run dev`)
- **`vite.config.ts`**: Vite configuration. Sets up React plugin and path aliases
- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration. Defines compiler options and type checking rules
- **`tailwind.config.js`**: Tailwind customization. Adds custom colors and theme settings
- **`index.html`**: Entry point. Contains the `<div id="root">` where React mounts

### **[`src`](src ) Folder - Main Application Code**

#### **`components/` Folder**
Reusable UI pieces. Think of these as Lego blocks that can be used across different pages.

**`ui/` Subfolder** - Shadcn/UI Components (Pre-built, customizable):
- **`button.tsx`**: Button component with variants (primary, secondary, destructive)
- **`card.tsx`**: Card containers for grouping content
- **`dialog.tsx`**: Modal/pop-up windows
- **`input.tsx`**: Form input fields
- **`table.tsx`**: Data tables with sorting and pagination
- **`alert-dialog.tsx`**: Confirmation dialogs ("Are you sure?")

**Custom Components**:
- **`Layout.tsx`**: Main app wrapper. Includes navbar, sidebar, and content area. Uses React Router's `<Outlet>`
- **`Navbar.tsx`**: Top navigation bar with app title, theme toggle, and user avatar
- **`Sidebar.tsx`**: Left navigation menu with links to different pages
- **`StatCard.tsx`**: Reusable card for displaying statistics (income, expenses, etc.)
- **`TransactionModal.tsx`**: Modal for adding/editing transactions (currently display-only)
- **`DeleteConfirmationDialog.tsx`**: Confirmation dialog for delete actions

#### **`context/` Folder**
Global state management. Instead of passing data through props manually, Context makes data available anywhere.

- **`ThemeContext.tsx`**: Manages dark/light theme switching. Provides `toggleTheme()` function
- **`TransactionContext.tsx`**: Provides mock transaction data to all components

#### **`data/` Folder**
Static data for the app. Since we removed real functionality, this acts as our "database".

- **`mockData.ts`**: Contains:
  - `Transaction` interface (TypeScript type definition)
  - Sample transactions array
  - Category definitions
  - Monthly data for charts
  - Summary statistics

#### **`pages/` Folder**
Main application screens. Each is a React component that renders when you navigate to that route.

- **`Dashboard.tsx`**: Home page with overview stats, charts, and recent transactions
- **`Transactions.tsx`**: Full transaction list with search, filters, and action buttons
- **`Analytics.tsx`**: Detailed charts and data visualizations
- **`Settings.tsx`**: User preferences and app settings
- **`NotFound.tsx`**: 404 error page for invalid URLs

#### **`lib/` Folder**
Utility functions and helpers.

- **`utils.ts`**: Helper functions like date formatting and currency display

## üîÑ How Data Flows Through the App

1. **Data Source**: `mockData.ts` contains all sample data
2. **Global State**: `TransactionContext.tsx` makes data available app-wide
3. **Page Components**: Pages like `Dashboard.tsx` consume data via `useContext()`
